## App Components

I used a few different graphic components to make this application:
- [py_echarts](https://pyecharts.org/): Python wrapper for ECharts; used for the bar charts 
- [plotly] (https://plotly.com/python/): Used for the map graphic 
- [streamlit-aggrid] (https://pypi.org/project/streamlit-aggrid/): Used for the interactive dataframes

## Data 

The script to populate this application is not hosted on Github. I can provide the script upon request. You can download listing data for your own use.
